                        ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                        startup. ‚Äù

                        ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure
                        from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                        by
                        a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum
                        and staff
                        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The
                        agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                        that
                        no tutorial
                        could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                        my
                        developent
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                        multiple offers.
                        100% recommend! ‚Äù
